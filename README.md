## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Material UI
- **Backend**: Go, PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Weather.gov for forecasts, Twilio for SMS

## Weather.gov Integration

Pow Hunter uses the National Weather Service (NWS) API to get accurate snow forecasts for ski resorts. The application:

1. Retrieves grid coordinates based on resort latitude/longitude
2. Fetches detailed snowfall predictions for each resort
3. Checks forecasts against user alert criteria
4. Delivers timely SMS notifications through Twilio

## Getting Started

- PostgreSQL
- Node.js 18+

## How It Works

1. Users sign up and set alert preferences:
   - Email and phone number
   - Minimum snow amount (in inches)
   - Notification days in advance (1-5)
   - Selected ski resorts

2. Every 12 hours, the system:
   - Fetches the latest snow forecasts from Weather.gov
   - Identifies matching user alerts
   - Sends SMS notifications for new forecasts
   - Records sent alerts to prevent duplicates
